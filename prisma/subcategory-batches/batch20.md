  "title": "Cinematic Studio Portrait",
  "aspectRatio": "4:5",
  "reusablePrompt": "A [mood] [subject] portrait against a [color] studio backdrop, lit by [lighting], wearing [style] clothing, shot on [camera], shallow depth of field, [angle] composition, [detail] skin texture, high-end editorial photography",
  "filledImagePrompt": "A confident businesswoman portrait against a muted charcoal studio backdrop, lit by soft key light with a subtle rim, wearing a tailored navy blazer, shot on an 85mm prime lens, shallow depth of field, chest-up frontal composition, natural pore-level skin texture, high-end editorial photography"
